    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/headshot.png" alt="Headshot" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <p>I graduated from The University of Washington in 2016 with a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry and Neurobiology. I am currently working at the Jayadev Neurology Lab at the University of Washington, studying Alzheimer's Disease. My current project involves dissociating brain tissue into single nuclei and analyzing the RNA and chromatin map of each nucleus to determine the effect of mutations known to be associated with Alzheimer's Disease on biological networks, in a cell-type specific manner.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy staying active. My favorite activities include hiking, foraging for mushrooms, playing softball, an lifting weights. I also spend time with my cat and russian tortoise, who both enjoy cuddling in front of my heater.</p>
